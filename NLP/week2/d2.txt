The city was named after revered teacher Dronacharya of epic Mahabharata. It is believed that Dronacharya was gifted this ancestral village by his disciples, the Pandavas and Kauravas. He gave spiritual instructions to them at this place. Today the same place is marked with development, modern facilities and a planned infrastructure. The public-private sector partnership model in real estate development has been the major force behind Gurugram's emergence as the corporate capital. Its close proximity to the National Capital Region has also resulted in Gurugram becoming a corporate hub of BPO companies, IT companies, etc. in an uptrend in the hospitality industry here, with MICE tourism being the major driving force. Gurugram with its location on NH-8, closer to international airport, offers world-class commercial development, entertainment centers and shopping complexes.
